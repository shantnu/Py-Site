		<description><![CDATA[I stumbled across your blog by accident, while looking for a way to find work that isn&#039;t mind-numbing and soul-destroying, I am really glad I found your posts - I have ordered the Thrive book from Amazon as well.  It makes total sense to work on yourself, decide on what goals you want to achieve and then go for them.  I understand the message that going for your dream is difficult, but necessary, unless you want to degenerate and get worse as you get older.  Thanks again for your posts, they are really useful. Best wishes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, I am in the same situation you are in. I&#039;m in a job that isn&#039;t related to my degree I&#039;m 6 months into this job but I can&#039;t leave because of a one year bond. 

I really liked this line &quot;There is a price to pay if you chase after your dreams. But also remember that there will be a bigger price to pay if you crush your dreams and do nothing.  You have to pay the price either way, but at least one path leads to happiness.&quot;. I really need to stop settling for a job that doesn&#039;t fulfill me (though its high paying) and pursue my passion in life. 

Thanks for this man. really appreciate it.

Yes, many of these situations are general, and could affect anyone. I mention programmers, as I am one and hence know of their problems firsthand.]]></description>
