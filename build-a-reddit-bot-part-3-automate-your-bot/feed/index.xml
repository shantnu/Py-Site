		<description><![CDATA[The sudo pip install praw command wasn&#039;t working for me with the http url. I specified it as an https. That changed the error message. Now it says:

Downloading/unpacking praw
  Running setup.py egg_info for package praw
    Couldn&#039;t find index page for &#039;pytest-runner&#039; (maybe misspelled?)
    No local packages or download links found for pytest-runner&#062;=2.1

I&#039;m a beginner and would appreciate any advice on what to try next.

Thank you so much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey everyone.  I was having some issues with crontab and think I found a universal solution for all Unix-based users (any linux distro or iOS).  If you are running Ubuntu 18.04 and are struggling to get your python file to run in cron, then you&#039;re in the exact same boat as me.  If you&#039;re running Windows, then the only advice I can offer is to install Git and use the Git Bash terminal, but I&#039;m not positive that will work.

After much googling, I found this answer on Stack Overflow that steered me in the right direction:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26049459/python-script-not-running-in-cron/38682365#38682365

My understanding is that cron and Python don&#039;t always work well together for some reason.  So this person came up with the idea to write a shell script (file extension is .sh) that executes the Python file and have cron call that instead.

Instead of the line given in the tutorial written in your crontab file, use the following line instead:

* * * * * sh /home/[yourUserName]/auto_delete.sh

I&#039;m not sure if it is necessary to have this script in your home directory or not, but mine is.  Also, you can name your file whatever you want, but I just copied the the user&#039;s example and I&#039;m too lazy to change it.

For your shell script, make sure it is in the same directory that you wrote in your cron file and has the same name (/home/[yourUserName]/auto_delete.sh). Use any text editor (I chose Vim) and have it say the following, but just know that I&#039;m not a shell scripting expert and only know a handful of useful commands:

#!/bin/sh
echo $(date) &#062;&#062; bash_cron_log.txt
/[your]/[directory]/[where]/[python]/[executable]/[is]/[installed] /[your]/[directory]/[where]/[bot]/[file]/[is]/[located]/someBotFile.py &#062;&#062; bash_cron_log.txt

What this will do create a text file (or append to an existing text file) called bash_cron_log.txt in the same directory as your shell script.  Also, this will be where all of your output from your Python file is written.  For example, if you have print(&quot;connected&quot;) in your python file after your Reddit instantiation, it will write &quot;connected&quot; out to that .txt file.  However, you will need to edit your Python file to access the correct directory for posts_replied_to.txt, unless you&#039;re okay with it being in the same file as your shell script.  For example, this is what my text file looked like after I had that print statement in my python script for 3 minutes:

Wed Oct 3 22:27:01 CDT 2018
Wed Oct 3 22:28:01 CDT 2018
Wed Oct 3 22:29:01 CDT 2018
connected
Wed Oct 3 22:30:01 CDT 2018
connected
Wed Oct 3 22:31:01 CDT 2018
connected
Wed Oct 3 22:32:01 CDT 2018
Wed Oct 3 22:33:01 CDT 2018
Wed Oct 3 22:34:01 CDT 2018

Notice that all the times are exactly 1 minute apart.  This is because cron&#039;s minimum time between runs is 1 minute (I think this is true).  If you want it to run more frequently than 1 minute intervals, then you need to use something else.

If you don&#039;t know where your Python executable is installed, just type &quot;which python&quot; in your terminal and it will give you the exact path you need to for that first argument you&#039;re looking for.

Okay, I think I covered everything.  Thank you Shantnu for making this tutorial and that subreddit for us to play around in.  If I made a mistake anywhere in here, whether it&#039;s a typo or I&#039;m misunderstanding a concept, please let me know and I&#039;ll change it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Shantnu, thanks for the great tuto !
I am creating my bot on the linux subsystem on windows 10 instead of a VM, so I don&#039;t really know where to pick up on the 3 part 
Very noob question indeed, I don&#039;t usually write in python, nor do I use linux so I&#039;m a bit lost
Thanks again for giving us some of your time !]]></description>
