		<description><![CDATA[I strongly desagree that people with internal locus are better off regarding depression. 
The form of internal locus of control you are describing requires a tremendous amount of perspective on oneself an one&#039;s actions. If you think everything depends on you, an only you, the amount of pressure will make you crumble. I believe it takes a certain balance between both internal and external locus to achive a somewhat satisfactory life. Doing everything that is in your power is completely fine, but remembering that you&#039;re not almighty and letting a certain amount of things run their course is equally as important.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lois,

This is caused by a lack of self esteem and lack of internal focus. Fix these 2 things, you won&#039;t slide back. The book Thrive by Rob Kelly is highly recommended, the only self help book I recommend (since it&#039;s based on scientific research and practice, not goody goody thoughts).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great blog on mind numbing depression. I wonder if you really can reprogramme yourself or do we always revert to our original settings. I am sitting at my desk with a fuzzy brain wondering if I am ever going to get my act together. I come out of depression occasionally, but always seem to slide back down the hole.]]></description>
