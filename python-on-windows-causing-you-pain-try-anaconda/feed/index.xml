		<description><![CDATA[I use Powershell.
I was trying a Python 3 environment.
I typed activate, it changed the command prompt to show the py3 environment had been activated.

Yet when I ran the python command, it still ran Python 2.7. The only way to run the Python 3 interpreter was to go into that directory, which beats the purpose of environments.

 Going online, it seems quite a few people have faced this problem, and there are many creative solutions. However, I don&#039;t have the time or inclination to try them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments and feedback.  

I&#039;m curious, though, about your statement that environments don&#039;t work.   What does that mean?   What did you try?   Which shell are you using (the standard cmd.exe shell?)

There is a command &quot;activate&quot; that will activate your environment.  If you have an environment named &quot;test&quot;, then the command &quot;activate test&quot; will make that your default environment.    If you find a bug, the open source project conda would love to receive your bug-report.]]></description>
