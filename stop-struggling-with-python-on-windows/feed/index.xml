		<description><![CDATA[Yes, delete it.

Also have a look at the anaconda forums- this might be a bug they know about. If not, you migth be able to raise a new one]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi all, i came here because I had a strange situation when working on anaconda with windows. At first everything worked perfectly but since i created a separate virtual env and loaded it to run a separate code from terminal in this new environment, I have been having issues running code on jupyter notebook. i was just not able to read a simple hdf file that returned a value error but the point is I cannot comprehend what happened and now after uninstalling and reinstalling anaconda, I am still having the same problem. I also noticed that after uninstalling anaconda, I still have the anaconda folder in my directory. I want to know if it is safe to manually delete it? Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post! I&#039;ve been programming on both pylin and pywin for a number of few years now, bouncing between machines, vms, oses, and ides, virtualenvs / enviros for different projects. And yeah, it&#039;s an elephant in the room for a mostly love-blinded python convert from 10 or so years back, but... I&#039;ve kinda gotten used to the open-pit-toilet of the std pywin experience. 

If my primary win box ever gains enough space i&#039;ll be sure to give ana a crack, like I should have some time ago. But when you&#039;re walking over a spaghetti bridge high above a croc-infested-turd-river filled with sharp rocks, the changes happen... slowly and carefully. ;)

Oh, and yes, your point is well made. Just because i do have wizard powers (including lightning from fingers) and have gotten through all the hellish hurdles to make things work, that doesn&#039;t make me a clever-clogs because so little of the struggle was time well spent. Rather, it was time spent being an I-can&#039;t-let-things-go-nerd, to my own detriment. 
Shame, Mr Impractial-pants, shame.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My sentiments exactly in regards to the painful process of getting Python to work on Windows 10. 
I&#039;m glad you talked about installing it 8 times not working because that was my next move. I suspected it wouldn&#039;t make a difference so I am going to try some of the other suggestions here. 

Thanks for the article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even Anaconda is not straightforward with Windows in a corporate environment where things that are free is looked at with suspicion. Its a Nightmare when  you attempt conda create -n pyxxx python=x.x.x  only to result in a connection timeout error. Rather for winpython works for standard libraries like numpy, and scipy. But with matplotlib it crashes too.

		<description><![CDATA[I have a question or two: 

Why Anaconda over some of the other SciPy stack offerings? I come from a MATLAB background and thus Python (x,y) looks nice to me. Ideally I would find something cross-platform (I use Linux, Mac, and Windows) which Python (x,y) is not. These are the offerings I&#039;ve been considering:

Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

Python (x,y): https://python-xy.github.io/

WinPython: https://winpython.github.io/

Pyzo: http://www.pyzo.org/]]></description>
