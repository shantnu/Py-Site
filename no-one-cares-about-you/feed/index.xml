Currently, dev.to is considered friendly, though this may change in a few years. 

If you regularly follow programming links on places like Reddit or hacker news, you are bound to find friendly sites]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am currently having similar issues. I am architect of my own project. It works, have proven it to work, but I cannot show my strategy. I need it converted from what it is to another language, but only a small part. Would be about 20 lines of Python code.
I have read beginner books, .py forums, asked in otehr forums where I KNOW they have the solution, but no. RTFM....or replies similar, just candy coated replies worded in such a way as if this game is going on, how to mess with the person asking the question if they are new.

So, where do we &quot;mortals&quot; go to have Python codes snippets answered, and then be on our way ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a  software developer...and found your article really good :)

There is a real problem in the programmers community : arrogance.

I think what most of us programmers lack is maturity. I see a lot of people complaining about being misunderstood and let down, but they do the same thing to their managers/colleagues. 

But of course it&#039;s not always black or white, you can work on your attitude, I try to do it as much as possible and I really see the benefits.

However, I&#039;ll never use StackOverflow again, this is the perfect example of a community gone horribly wrong.]]></description>
