		<description><![CDATA[Small software house. 6 developers.It took me 2 years to drag the team into version control and I still get told it&#039;s rubbish when they use it incorrectly.

If you are not using what I now call &quot;collaboration control&quot;, you are digging trenches with a spoon, and good luck but I&#039;m out of here,

Why version control?
which folder has the most recent code for that client ?
what broke the latest version I built ?
what changes have been made to the clients latest live release so I can work out what might have broken it at 2:00am
my disk got wiped, I&#039;ve lost the last weeks work!
have I got the changes that developer&#039;s x,y,z  made last week ?
take your pick.

Which VCS.
I played with SVN, nope. Mercurial, better but DVCS meant that everyone commited locally and we ended up with unmergable code, nope. Discovered fossil. 

Why fossil? 
1. Checkin comments can be altered and clarified when you see them in a month&#039;s time and wonder WTF that description means.
2 Single exe. No install.
3. We copied the Apple OSx version to the Mac Mini server with the repositories on, to serve the Web front end. Windows exe on the Win7 dev machines.
4. scriptable.
5. relocate repositories with a simple copy.

I did end up writing a right click context menu front end so I could enforce some rules regarding repository locations, adapt to Windows where file names are not case sensitive, etc. and nobody had to remember any commands.( 2,500 line batch script fine )]]></description>
